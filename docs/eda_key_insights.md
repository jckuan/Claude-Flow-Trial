# EDA Key Insights - Quick Reference

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Records**: 1,017,209
- **Stores**: 1,115 unique stores
- **Date Range**: 2013-01-01 to 2015-07-31 (941 days)
- **Missing Values**: None ✅
- **Zero Sales**: 172,871 records (17.0% - closed stores)

## 🎯 Top Findings

### 1. Customer Count = Sales Predictor #1
- **Correlation**: 0.895 with sales
- **Insight**: Customer count is the strongest single predictor
- **Action**: Must include as core feature

### 2. Promotions Drive Massive Sales
- **Lift**: +81.37% increase in average sales
- **Impact**: $4,406 (no promo) → $7,991 (promo)
- **Action**: Critical feature + interaction terms needed

### 3. Strong Temporal Patterns

**Weekly Pattern:**
- Monday: $7,809 (highest)
- Sunday: $204 (most stores closed)
- Mid-week decline pattern

**Monthly Pattern:**
- December: $6,827 (peak - holiday season)
- January/May: Lower sales (post-holiday slump)

**Action**: Day of week and month features essential

### 4. Store Heterogeneity
- **Top Store**: $20,719 average sales
- **Bottom Store**: $2,245 average sales
- **Ratio**: 9.2x difference
- **Action**: Store-specific features critical

### 5. Clean, High-Quality Data
- ✅ No missing values
- ✅ No duplicates
- ✅ Consistent structure
- ✅ Logical value ranges

## 🔧 Priority Feature Engineering

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. **Temporal Features**
   - Day of week, month, quarter
   - Week of year
   - Is weekend flag
   - Holiday proximity

2. **Lag Features**
   - Sales_Lag7, Sales_Lag14
   - Sales_RollingMean_7, Sales_RollingMean_30
   - Year-over-year comparisons

3. **Store Features**
   - Store average sales
   - Store sales volatility
   - Store promo effectiveness

### Medium Priority
4. **Interaction Features**
   - Promo × DayOfWeek
   - SchoolHoliday × DayOfWeek
   - Store × Promo

5. **Derived Features**
   - Sales per customer
   - Log(Sales + 1)
   - Customer density

## ⚠️ Modeling Considerations

### Critical Rules
1. **Filter Closed Stores**: Remove or model separately (Open==0)
2. **Log Transform**: Use log(Sales+1) for target
3. **Time-Based Split**: Last 6-8 weeks for validation
4. **Metric**: RMSPE (competition metric)

### Risk Mitigation
- ⚠️ Don't overfit to recent trends
- ⚠️ Account for store heterogeneity
- ⚠️ Handle zero sales properly
- ⚠️ Use time-series CV

## 📈 Statistical Highlights

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean Sales | $5,773.82 |
| Median Sales | $5,744.00 |
| Std Dev | $3,849.93 |
| Skewness | 0.641 (right-skewed) |
| Sales-Customer Correlation | **0.895** |
| Promo Lift | **+81.4%** |

## 🎓 Domain Insights

1. **Monday is King**: Highest sales day (shopping after weekend)
2. **Sunday Mystery**: Most stores closed (German retail law?)
3. **December Magic**: Holiday shopping drives 24% higher sales
4. **Promo Power**: Nearly doubles sales - extremely effective
5. **Store Variance**: Some stores are superstars, others struggle

## 🚀 Next Steps Priority

1. ✅ Load store.csv and merge additional features
2. ✅ Create baseline temporal + lag features
3. ✅ Implement time-based train/validation split
4. ✅ Build LightGBM baseline model
5. ✅ Calculate baseline RMSPE

- **Visualizations**: `/docs/*.png` (generated by notebook)

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**"Customer count + Promo + Temporal patterns = 90% of the story"**

This dataset is clean, well-structured, and has clear predictive signals. Success depends on properly capturing temporal dynamics and store-level heterogeneity without overfitting.
